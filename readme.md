# pyTelebot

Simple telegram bot with the following features:
- Send message/images to your Telegram account
- Receive messages/files from your Telegram account


##Â TODO:
- IP lookup
- Connection status
- Send any type of files
- Automatise the generation of chatId (atm it needs to be done manually)
- Rationalise Message class to be more than just an organisation feature
- Change "core" into a processUpdate class
